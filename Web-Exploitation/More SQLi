PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Can you find the flag on this website?

HINTS:
1. SQLiLite

APPROACH:
1. Login page has a SQL injection vulnerability.
2. Once logged into the portal, there displays a search box which is again vulnerable to SQLi.
3. Here SQL Lite database is used.
4. From finding the version of database used to finding the column in a particular table, i crafted multiple SQL payloads
and finally found the flag column which led me to the actual flag.
