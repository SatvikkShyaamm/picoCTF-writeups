PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Do you know how to use the web inspector?

HINT:
1. Use the web inspector on other files included by the web page.
2. The flag may or may not be encoded

APPROACH:
1. Among the three sections such as 'home','about' and 'contact' one has the flag.
2. in the 'about' section, within the inspect page of the file there will be a base64-encoded string.
3. Decoding it using the tool will give us the flag.
