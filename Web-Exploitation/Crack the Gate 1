PROBLEM STATEMENT:
We’re in the middle of an investigation. 
One of our persons of interest, ctf player, is believed to be hiding sensitive data inside a restricted web portal. 
We’ve uncovered the email address he uses to log in: ctf-player@picoctf.org. 
Unfortunately, we don’t know the password, and the usual guessing techniques haven’t worked. 
But something feels off... it’s almost like the developer left a secret way in. Can you figure it out?

HINT:
Developers sometimes leave notes in the code; but not always in plain text.
A common trick is to rotate each letter by 13 positions in the alphabet.
