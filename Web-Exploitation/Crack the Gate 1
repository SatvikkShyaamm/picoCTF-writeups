PROBLEM STATEMENT:
We’re in the middle of an investigation. 
One of our persons of interest, ctf player, is believed to be hiding sensitive data inside a restricted web portal. 
We’ve uncovered the email address he uses to log in: ctf-player@picoctf.org. 
Unfortunately, we don’t know the password, and the usual guessing techniques haven’t worked. 
But something feels off... it’s almost like the developer left a secret way in. Can you figure it out?

HINT:
1. Developers sometimes leave notes in the code; but not always in plain text.
2. A common trick is to rotate each letter by 13 positions in the alphabet.

APPROACH:
1. Hyperlink leads to a website.
2. From the hints we can understand that some information is given as comments in html document and it is encoded in ROT13.
3. Decoding the message gives us the answer as NOTE: Jack - temporary bypass: use header "X-Dev-Access: yes"
4. Use the mail id given in the problem statement.
5. Give some random password to make sure login action happens properly.
6. Now using the Burp Suite intercept the login request and add the found header.
7. In the header X means custom header, Dev means developer, Access is used to aquire the specific privilege, yes provides the 
access.
