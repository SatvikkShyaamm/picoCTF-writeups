PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Hi, intrepid investigator! 📄🔍 You've stumbled upon a peculiar PDF filled with what seems like nothing more than garbled nonsense. 
But beware! Not everything is as it appears. 
Amidst the chaos lies a hidden treasure—an elusive flag waiting to be uncovered.

HINTS:
1. Don't be fooled by the visible text; it’s just a decoy!
2. Look beyond the surface for hidden clues

PROBLEM APPROACH:
1. Confidential.pdf is provided.
2. Hints tell us that flag is hidden in the metadata
3. using the "exiftool" we can find that the author name is encoded in base64
4. Decoding the base64 encoded message gives us the flag.
