PROBLEM STATEMENT:
The SOC team discovered a suspiciously large log file after a recent breach. 
When they opened it, they found an enormous block of encoded text instead of typical logs. 
Could there be something hidden within? Your mission is to inspect the resulting file and reveal the real purpose of it. 
The team is relying on your skills to uncover any concealed information within this unusual log.

HINTS:
1. Use base64 to decode the data and generate the image file.

APPROACH:
1. Download the .txt file 
2. cat command lets you open the text file in the terminal
3. the whole text file is encoded in base64 and its too large
4. using the built in base64 tool decode the whole file -> gives an image as output
5. the hex code found in the image is the flag.
