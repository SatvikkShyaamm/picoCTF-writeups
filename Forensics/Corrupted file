PROBLEM STATEMENT:
This file seems broken... or is it? 
Maybe a couple of bytes could make all the difference. Can you figure out how to bring it back to life?

HINTS:
1. Try checking the file’s header.
2. JPEG
3. Tools like xxd or hexdump can help you inspect and edit file bytes.

APPROACH:
1. Download the corrupted file
2. using the command hexdump -C filename | head, i was able to view the first bytes of the file
3. That showed the file was broken
4. I replaced the incorrect bytes with the correct bytes and saved the file
5. Opening the file showed me the flag.
