PROBLLEM STATEMENT:
Our server seems to be leaking pieces of a secret flag in its logs. The parts are scattered and sometimes repeated. Can you reconstruct the original flag? Download the logs and figure out the full flag from the fragments.

HINTS:
You can use grep to filter only matching lines from the log.
Some lines are duplicates; ignore extra occurrences.

APPROACH:
using cat command check the log file.
since we have n number of logs we will be using grep command.
cat and grep command will let us display the content in file according to the pattern we are looking for.
example : cat log.txt | grep "picoCTF{" -> this will be giving the first part of the flag and changing the pattern will give us other parts of flags.
